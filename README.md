## Data

TESS data (link). Trained using

### Preprocessing Pipeline

Binned, median, subtracted etc.


## Usage

All hyperparameters are controlled via command line arguments. 


## General TODO for code

- [ ] get to max GPU utilisation
- [ ] Seperate out injected transit data
- [ ] Add example light curves, targets, predictions from val set as logs on wandb to help debugging
